## Async Rust

## Included Projects

1. [Block On with Futures](./futures_block_on/). Using `block_on` to start an async runtime.
2. [Block On with Tokio](./tokio_block_on/). Using `block_on` with options to start a Tokio runtime.
3. [Hello Tokio](./hello_tokio/). Start a runtime and `await` your first function.
4. [Tokio Joining](./tokio_join/). Using `join` to run multiple tasks concurrently. Switch between single-threaded and multi-threaded execution to see the difference in output.
